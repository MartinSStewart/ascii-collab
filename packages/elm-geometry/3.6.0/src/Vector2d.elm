{-| A `Vector2d` represents a quantity such as a displacement or velocity in 2D,
and is defined by its X and Y components. This module contains a variety of
vector-related functionality, such as

  - Adding or subtracting vectors
  - Finding the lengths of vectors
  - Rotating vectors
  - Converting vectors between different coordinate systems

Note that unlike in many other geometry packages where vectors are used as a
general-purpose data type, `elm-geometry` has separate data types for vectors,
directions and points. In most code it is actually more common to use `Point2d`
and `Direction2d` than `Vector2d`, and much code can avoid working directly with
`Vector2d` values at all!

@docs Vector2d


# Constants

@docs zero

Although there are no predefined constants for the vectors with components
(1,0) and (0,1), in most cases you will actually want their `Direction2d`
versions [`Direction2d.x`](Direction2d#x) and [`Direction2d.y`](Direction2d#y).


# Literals

@docs unitless

The remaining functions all construct a `Vector2d` from X and Y components given
in specific units. Functions like `Vector2d.xy` are more useful in generic code,
but these functions are useful for quickly creating hardcoded constant values,
e.g.

    vector =
        Vector2d.meters 2 3

@docs meters, pixels, millimeters, centimeters, inches, feet


# Constructors

@docs xy, xyIn, rTheta, rThetaIn, from, withLength, perpendicularTo, interpolateFrom


# Interop

These functions are useful for interoperability with other Elm code that uses
plain `Float` tuples or records to represent vectors.

@docs fromTuple, toTuple, fromRecord, toRecord


## Zero-copy conversions

These functions allow zero-overhead conversion of vectors to and from records
with `x` and `y` `Float` fields, useful for efficient interop with other code
that represents vectors as plain records.

@docs fromMeters, toMeters, fromPixels, toPixels, fromUnitless, toUnitless


# Rates of change

@docs per, for


# Properties

@docs components, xComponent, yComponent, componentIn, length, direction


# Comparison

@docs equalWithin, lexicographicComparison


# Arithmetic

@docs plus, minus, dot, cross, sum, twice, half


## Vector/scalar products

@docs product, times, over, over_


# Transformations

Note that for `mirrorAcross` and `projectOnto`, only the direction of the axis
affects the result, since vectors are position-independent. Think of
mirroring/projecting a vector across/onto an axis as moving the vector so its
tail is on the axis, then mirroring/projecting its tip across/onto the axis.

@docs reverse, normalize, scaleBy, rotateBy, rotateClockwise, rotateCounterclockwise, mirrorAcross, projectionIn, projectOnto


# Unit conversions

@docs at, at_


# Coordinate conversions

Like other transformations, coordinate conversions of vectors depend only on the
orientations of the relevant frames, not the positions of their origin points.

For the examples, assume the following frame has been defined:

    rotatedFrame =
        Frame2d.atOrigin
            |> Frame2d.rotateBy (Angle.degrees 30)

@docs relativeTo, placeIn


# Advanced

These functions are unsafe because they require you to track units manually. In
general you should prefer other functions instead, but these functions may be
useful when writing generic/library code.

{-| Find the scalar 'cross product' of two vectors in 2D. This is useful in many
of the same ways as the 3D cross product:

  - Its length is equal to the product of the lengths of the two given vectors
    and the sine of the angle between them, so it can be used as a metric to
    determine if two vectors are nearly parallel.
  - The sign of the result indicates the direction of rotation from the first
    vector to the second (positive indicates a counterclockwise rotation and
    negative indicates a clockwise rotation), similar to how the direction of
    the 3D cross product indicates the direction of rotation.
